                <p>My Name is Shally. I did my masters in computer applications and learnt French language for 3 years. While I was studying, I got an opportunity to teach French over the weekends. I loved teaching a lot. Language classes are a lot of fun and it gave me a lot of satisfaction when I saw my students speaking a foreign language. Part of my job was also to train students for Visa interviews in French. 
                </p>
                <p>I started my first full time job with Wipro Technologies in Bangalore, India in 2006 as a QA Engineer where I got opportunity to work with globalization team where I could use both computer skills and French knowledge. From there, I moved to Citrix Systems and spent 6 years helping improve the quality of several Citrix products.I also Got to take initiatives for several process improvements projects, QA activities.
                </p>
                <p>I moved to US in early 2015. In US my first job was with YouTube as a contract employee. I worked with YouTube for close to an year. After that I joined Nimble storage which is now part of HPE.
                </p>
                <p>Apart from work, I love visiting new places, spending time with my one year old son and hanging out with friends.
                </p>
                <p>That's pretty much it about my journey till now. Learning Web Development is the newest challenge I have taken that helped me create this page.
